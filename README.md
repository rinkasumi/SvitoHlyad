## A Note from the Developer

Before diving into the details, Iâ€™d like to clarify that Iâ€™m not a professional web developer. I learned SQLAlchemy and Quart while creating this bot, so it may not be perfect. However, Iâ€™m proud to present one of the first fully functional Telegram moderation bots available on GitHub!

## Features

- Moderation tools such as Mute, Ban, Kick, and Reports (Warn is coming soon).
- Management through an integrated website interface.
- Additional features that are better discovered at runtime for security reasons.

## Repository Setup

Follow these steps to clone the repository and set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aleksfolt/Waffle-Moderator.git
   cd Waffle-Moderator

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    # On Linux/macOS:
    python3 -m venv venv
    
    # On Windows:
    python -m venv venv

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    # On Linux/macOS:
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
4. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Telegram

1. **Create a Bot**:  
   - Go to [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram and create a new bot.  
   - Copy the token provided by BotFather after creating the bot.

2. **Set the Webhook URL**:  
   - In BotFather, use the `/setdomain` command to set the webhook URL for your bot.
   - Choose your bot and provide your domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`).

3. **Configure Your Bot**:  
   - Open the `config.py` file in the project.
   - Paste your bot token into the `BOT_TOKEN` variable.
   - Optionally, change the bots name by modifying the `BOT_NAME` variable.

## Database Setup

To deploy the bot, you need to set up a PostgreSQL database. Follow these steps:

1. **Install PostgreSQL (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   # On Ubuntu/Debian:
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib

   # On macOS (via Homebrew):
   brew install postgresql

   # On Windows:
   # Download and install PostgreSQL from https://www.postgresql.org/download/
   
 2. **Start PostgreSQL Service:**
    ```bash
    # On Ubuntu/Debian:
    sudo service postgresql start
    
    # On macOS:
    brew services start postgresql

3. **Create the Database and User:**
    ```bash
    # Access the PostgreSQL shell as the postgres user:
    sudo -u postgres psql
    
    # Inside the PostgreSQL shell, run the following commands:
    CREATE DATABASE waffledb;
    CREATE USER waffle WITH PASSWORD 'FromSiberiaLove';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE waffledb TO waffle;
    
    # Exit the PostgreSQL shell:
    \q

4. **psql -h localhost -U waffle -d waffledb**
    ```bash
    psql -h localhost -U waffle -d waffledb

5. **Optional Configuration:**
If you prefer to use different database credentials, update the following values in the config.py file:
    ```python
    DATABASE_URL = (
        "postgresql+asyncpg://waffle:FromSiberiaLove@localhost:5432/waffledb"
    )
    
    
## Start Bot

**Well, everything is ready! Now let's launch the bot:**
   ```python
    # On Linux/MacOs
    python3 main.py
    
    # On Windows
    python main.py
```

Notes for Shindows Users

- Filesystem Differences:

The bot may not work correctly on Windows due to differences in the filesystem and path handling. For the best experience, consider using a Linux-based environment or tools like [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)

- Database Connection:

Ensure PostgreSQL is properly configured and accessible on Windows. Use the connection details specified in the `config.py` file
